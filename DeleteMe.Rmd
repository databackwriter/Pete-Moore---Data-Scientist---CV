## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{python py-setup, include=FALSE}
# Internal variables setup (NB set up variables in python so can be passed to R)
editid = 0 #an id for this edit of the cv; set to zero to build new edition of CV
cvtypeid = 1 #1	Data Scientist; 2	IT Director; 3	SQL Server Expert; 4	Non-executive Director
# we want to utilise the included to build a model for thisCV 
PATH_FILE="/Users/petermoore/Documents/GitHub/Pete Moore - Data Scientist - CV/Python"
import os
os.chdir(PATH_FILE)
import sys
sys.path.append(PATH_FILE) #add local directory to path


pyvar = 12

```

```{r}
rvar=py$pyvar
print(rvar)
```
