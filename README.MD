# Smart CV

## Goal:
This code is designed to make the compilation of a CV a data-driven task rather than a job for copy and paste.
## Method:
Ultimately serving a CV in pdf format; the project utilises Rmarkdown's ability to work with all of R, Python and SQL.  
The journey the CV goes on is as follows: Word-Excel-MSSQL(Linux)-Rmarkdown
Categories are applied on a per paragraph/bullet point basis to allow different flavours of CV to be served: Data Scientist, SQL Server Expert, IT Director and Non-Executive Director
## Results
A variety of CVs are creatable via the project CVGenerator.Rmd
CV's created can be viewed in the CVs folder here
## Conclusion
It is entirely possible to build an automated CV production platform.  The code herein demonstrates how this is done.
